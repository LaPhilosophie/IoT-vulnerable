## Affected version

F1203 V2.0.1.6

## Vulnerability details

The Tenda F1203 V2.0.1.6 firmware has a stack overflow vulnerability located in the `fromWizardHandle` function. This function accepts the `WANT`and `WANS` parameter from a POST request. Within `case 2`, this function accepts the `PPW` parameter from a POST request, which is assigned to `decodePwd(pppoepwd, decode_pwd);`. However, since the user has control over the input of `PPW`, the function `decodePwd()` leads to a buffer overflow. The user-supplied `PPW` can exceed the capacity of the `decode_pwd` array, thus triggering this security vulnerability.
