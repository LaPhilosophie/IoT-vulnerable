## Vulnerability details

The Tenda AC10U v1.0 Firmware V15.03.06.48 has a stack overflow vulnerability located in the `formSetDeviceName` function. This function accepts the `mac` parameter from a POST request by `dev_id` variable and passes it to the `set_device_name` function.

Within `set_device_name`, the array `mib_name` is fixed at 128 bytes. However, since the user has control over the input of `mac`, the statement `sprintf(mib_name, "client.devicename%s", mac_addr);` leads to a buffer overflow. The user-supplied `mac` can exceed the capacity of the `mib_name` array, thus triggering this security vulnerability.
