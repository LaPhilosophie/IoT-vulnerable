## Affected version

AC10U v1.0 Firmware V15.03.06.49

## Vulnerability details

The Tenda AC10U v1.0 Firmware V15.03.06.49 firmware has a stack overflow vulnerability in the `formexeCommand` function. The `str` variable receives the `cmdinput` parameter from a POST request and is later assigned to the `cmd_buf` variable, which is fixed at 512 bytes. However, since the user can control the input of `cmdinput`, the statement `strcpy(cmd_buf, str);` can cause a buffer overflow. The user-provided `cmdinput` can exceed the capacity of the `cmd_buf` array, triggering this security vulnerability.
